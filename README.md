#What is this?
This website is made by NoSkillCorp which is no company. We wanted to help share tips and ideas in the terrific struggle that exists in overwatch.
There is no login, so content is completely anonymous.

#Please, add this feature !
Yeah of course we can, we already have a bunch of extra features that we want to add, but we're open for any ideas

#OH MY GOD, that's awesome, i need to contribue !
Yeah man, you should ! Open issue and make pull request as much as you want

#Tech
The website is built using rails & jquery and there are react components that will be added soon.

To run the website simply fork the github and run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate` and `rails -S` and you should be ready to go.
